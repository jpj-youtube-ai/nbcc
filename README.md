# charity-site

Containerised TypeScript service on AWS Fargate, fronted by an ALB, with a
Postgres (RDS) database and a couple of external API integrations. Two
environments (staging, production) with a build-once, promote-the-same-artifact
pipeline.

## What's here

```
src/                 Express + TypeScript app (health check, config, db, clients)
migrations/          node-pg-migrate migrations (expand-contract)
test/unit/           Vitest unit tests (DB-free)
features/            Cucumber BDD (.feature + JS step defs)
scripts/             bootstrap-aws.sh (one-time) + smoke.sh
infra/modules/app/   Reusable Terraform module (VPC, ALB, ECS, RDS, secrets)
infra/envs/          Thin per-env roots: staging/ and production/
.github/workflows/   pr.yml, deploy-staging.yml, deploy-prod.yml, infra.yml
```

## Prerequisites

- Node 20, Docker, AWS CLI v2, Terraform >= 1.6
- An AWS account and a GitHub repo

## Local development

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d db          # Postgres only
npm ci
npm run migrate                  # apply migrations
npm run dev                      # http://localhost:3000/health
```

Or run the whole thing in containers: `docker compose up` (and
`docker compose run --rm migrate` once to migrate).

Tests:

```bash
npm run test:unit                # Vitest, no DB needed
node dist/index.js & npm run test:bdd   # Cucumber against localhost
```

## One-time AWS bootstrap

CI assumes an IAM role via OIDC and keeps Terraform state in S3 - both must
exist before any workflow runs. Run once, as an admin:

```bash
GITHUB_ORG=your-org GITHUB_REPO=charity-site ./scripts/bootstrap-aws.sh
```

Then in GitHub repo Settings:
- Create Environments `staging` and `production`; add **required reviewers** to
  `production` (this is the prod deploy approval gate).
- On each environment set a variable `AWS_ROLE_ARN` to the role ARN the script
  printed.

Finally, set the real secret values (the bootstrap leaves placeholders):

```bash
aws ssm put-parameter --name /charity-site/staging/EXTERNAL_API_ONE_KEY \
  --type SecureString --value 'real-key' --overwrite
# ...repeat for EXTERNAL_API_TWO_KEY and for the production path.
```

## Provisioning infrastructure

Infra is **not** applied automatically on push (that's how a stray PR replaces
your database). Apply it deliberately:

- GitHub: **Actions -> Infra -> Run workflow -> environment: staging ->
  action: apply**. Repeat for production.
- Or locally: `cd infra/envs/staging && terraform init && terraform apply`.

Apply staging first, then production. On the very first apply the ECS service
starts with a placeholder image and is unhealthy until the first real deploy -
so run the staging pipeline (below) right after.

## Deploy flow

1. **Open a PR** -> `pr.yml` runs lint, build, migrations, **unit + BDD**.
2. **Merge to main** -> `deploy-staging.yml`:
   builds + pushes the image (tagged by commit SHA, to the shared ECR repo),
   runs migrations as a one-off task, deploys to ECS, smoke-tests `/health`,
   runs **unit + BDD against the live staging URL**, then tags a release.
3. Staging success triggers `deploy-prod.yml`, which **waits for approval**
   (production environment) then deploys the *same image* to production and
   smoke-tests it.

Rollback is automatic: the ECS deployment circuit breaker reverts to the last
healthy task set if a deploy fails its health checks, and a failed smoke/BDD
step stops the pipeline before it promotes.

## Configuration

Every config value lives in `src/config/schema.ts` and `.env.example`. Locally
they come from `.env`; in AWS the same keys are SSM parameters that ECS injects
as environment variables, so the app reads `process.env` identically in both.
Secrets are never in code or in the image.

## Cost & gotchas

- Tasks run in public subnets with no NAT gateway (saves ~£25-30/mo); the
  security groups only allow inbound from the ALB. Flip to private+NAT in
  `infra/modules/app/main.tf` if you must.
- RDS is `db.t4g.micro`, single-AZ in staging, multi-AZ in prod.
- The DB password is generated and stored in SSM, so it lands in Terraform
  state - keep the state bucket locked (the bootstrap script does). Or switch
  to `manage_master_user_password = true` (noted in `rds.tf`).
- The bootstrap IAM roles are broad (PowerUser + IAM). Tighten before prod.
- HTTPS isn't wired yet - add an ACM cert + 443 listener once you have a domain.
